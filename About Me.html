<Body>
<p>I was born in Lewiston, Maine on December 20th 1998. I was raised in Monmouth, Maine, which is a
very small town near both Augusta and Lewiston. My mum's name is Maia. She is a registered nurse and
works at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston. My mum loves to travel and lived many places around
the world working as a nurse before I was born. This is why she wanted to move my family to Australia
when I was 10. My dad's name is Shawn and he used to have a fiberglass company, but now he does stonework
and machanical work on cars. I live with my mum in Monmouth and my dad lives in Bowdoin. I also have two
brothers. My older brothers name is Michael and my younger brothers name is Evan.</p>

<p>I am a marketing and advertising major. I chose this major because I have always been interested in how
ads are produced and the entire process behind them. I plan on transferring away from Umaine soon
in order to attend a University in New York City, because every time I visit New York, it feels like home.
After being so many places at such a young age, I have learned that Maine is the last place I want to spend
my life.</p>

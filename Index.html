<h1>Amelia Freeman</h1>
<p style="text-align:center"> My name is Amelia Freeman. I'm from Monmouth, Maine which is about an hour and a half south of Orono. I have lived in Monmouth for most of my life, 
but when I was ten years old, my family moved to Australia for 4 months. I also traveled across Europe for a month when I was 7. Some of the places I have been include:
Japan, New Zealand, Australia, England, Scotland, France, Wales, and Canada, as well as various U.S. states. Because my childhood involved so much travelling, I enjoy it very much. 
Some of my other interests include fashion, watching documentaries, speaking French, horseback riding, and snowboarding. I also enjoy some reading but not much. 
I enjoy Ernest Hemingway novels, National Geographic Magazine, and Vogue magazine.</p>
